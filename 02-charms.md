# Charms

Regrettably, my children, you will find your powers are not my blessing. They are stolen from the Makers, who mostly languish as Demon Princes or deadbeats. Don't let the Emerald Mother deceive you with her verdant glory. She is derelict as the Devil Tyrant and her greens are just as rotten as those verdigris blades.

More powerful charms will be keyed to one or more of the Makers. When you learn such a charm, you must choose which Maker's version you have learned. Each Maker has a list of unacceptable actions. By your strength as my children, you may use the Makers' power for any cause you wish, but defying the essential nature of such power risks inflaming the Great Curse.

> **Unacceptable Actions**
> - Devil Tyrant: Bringing peace, except by overwhelming violence.
> - Lawmaker Princess: Being generous, except to create debt.
> - Perfect Hierarch: Destroying, except things of the Wyld.
> - Laughing Bodhisattva: Causing effect at distance, except if you provide means to reach you.
> - Bleak Nemesis: Creating light or enlightenment, except to cause a horrible revelation.
> - Great Mother: Burning, physically or emotionally, except by poison or acid or hatred. 
> - Great Maker: Destroying, except to rebuild.
> - Emerald Mother: Remaining static, except to grow something.

### Clay Body Liberation

Prerequisite: None

As Devil-Body Incarnation. I must admit you are still Infernal Exalted in shape, my children. Do not let that origin shackle you. You are not bound by the Makers' failings. The shapes you can take when freed from human limitation are pure and noble as you are.
