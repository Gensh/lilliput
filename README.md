It's been discussed heavily that the new Infernals are... less than stellar. I've said on a few occasions that it's difficult to repair Infernals because they're really quite broad. Without the overarching conceit of the Reclamation (even as vaporware), they're pushed in possibly too many directions. And Malfeas, like Autochthonia, is a setting which has basically nothing in common with the standard Exalted play experience.

Alchemicals likewise needed drastic surgery to be properly attached to Creation as a splat, but all that was really needed was to recontextualize their patriotism into the communal affections of the Autobots. Vanilla "Roboviet" Alchemicals aren't displaced by this change either. Infernals aren't as easily separated, even if the Yozis human forms are put way in the back. The current direction for Infernals also basically rules out most of the previous character concepts.

## Setting design goals

### Infernal themes

Every Exalt type has a lot of themes, but the various Infernal themes have trouble going together a lot of the time. The current canon direction is leaning on "the resentment of the Yozis" without actually involving the Yozis. It just kind of comes across as blandly edgy and another bad Cecelyne hypocrisy joke.

If we sketch them out roughly, the themes are something like:

- Chosen of generic badplace hell
- Chosen of the Green Sun, specifically
- Chosen of H.R. Giger
- The only true Primordial Exalted
- Primordials-in-waiting – bodies literally made of legend
- Agents of Yozi vengeance
- First Age Solars who remember everything
- Big scary transforming monsters
- Moustache-twirling villains
- Grimdark ultra-edgy 2000s villain narrative

Naturally, everyone wants to get rid of the bad grimdark. Easy. Likewise, generic badplace hell.

In my ten years of running mixed games, no one has cared about the First Age stuff. On the other hand, I've had two different Lunarfernal PCs, so "Solar vengeance quest, but green" is something I didn't hesitate to drop.

"Big scary tranforming monsters" is a core mechanical theme as well as storytelling, so that'll be kept.

For some reason, "Agents of Yozi vengeance" was the main story theme used for the new direction. Why? That's like the Eight Nations and Alchemicals. If Sondok's running a cult, just give her an Exaltation, and we don't even have to involve the rest of the Demon Realm to do the Yozis' will.

"Moustache-twirling villains" is fun for most folks but not everyone. So we can keep it but attach it to another awkward mechanic that half of everyone ignores – Limit. That's kind of where it was originally anyway.

That leaves us with a pruned list of:

- Chosen of the Green Sun, specifically
- Chosen of H.R. Giger
- The only true Primordial Exalted
- Primordials-in-waiting – bodies literally made of legend
- Big scary transforming monsters

That's a much more coherent body of themes. We get a lot of creepy flesh-warping and a deliberate blurring of physical and spiritual malignment.

### The Royal Blood shard

"Blueblood" is a shared universe that I and some other STs have kept rolling for years. Canon characters and allegiances shift with PC actions. There are currently three Yozis who've slipped the Surrender Oaths by PC action, and you know what – the setting has not fallen apart. Constantly hearing about how the Reclamation overshadows everything is exhausting. The Yozis are long-viewed and stagnant; there are many more pressing threats.

Because the Yozis overlook things "like elves do, but worse," entire poltical dramas can take place in the Demon Realm without them meaningfully participating. One of those has been Lillun's faction-building. Since every Infernal is Chosen for some trauma which resonates with the Yozis, many are prone to clinging to their new "mother" when surrounded by the stresses of such an alien realm.

We've reached a point where a certain metaplot is expiring with a default ending. The Jade Pleasure Dome exploding is a really spectacular distraction, so Lillun has decided to take her leave while the Yozis are howling about their things being broken. Half of the Infernal host has gone with her.

## How to use the Lilliputians

While I mentioned an easy way to introduce Creation-focused Infernals above, I don't want to introduce ambiguity when I bring in new players. The new canonical Infernals will represent a new philosophy on the part of the Yozis, the sixth generation of Infernal selection criteria, advanced by Ligier's current favorite.

Lilliputians are simultaneously a more classic experience and a somewhat new one. Lillun doesn't have much in the way of actual powers, but she has exchanged letters with Lytek for years and has reduced the burden of the Yozis on her Chosen as much as she can. She's the most immediately involved Exalted patron, of course, but as a (however undying) mere mortal, all she can do is ask other Lilliputians to pressure you when you ignore her plans.

Lillun is very much leaning into rewriting the Immaculate Philosophy. She intends for her Chosen to support Creation like the Dragons.

It was a common meme back in the heyday of Second Edition to suggest Infernals just abandon Creation to its problems and forge new worlds. While sometimes fun, that's just [VEHK's plan](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:The_36_Lessons_of_Vivec) – and VEHK is a coward. Given that Infernals are true Primordial Exalted, it's a more interesting story for them to restore the world in place of the Yozis. It's of course up to the PCs as to whether they're restoring it for good reasons or just to exploit again.

Like the titans before them, the Lilliputians are a family who don't necessarily like one another but have the same goals. Rather than tearing things down senselessly like Infernals, they're digging into the earth and regrowing society on their own backs. They're land gods, sustaining their provinces unnaturally and transforming their people into something more than mortal. If the gods won't sustain Creation, then it is up to the humans who live there.

## The state of the splat

Don't take the caste mechanics for Gospel. I started by directly copying from the Infernal castes and adapting to be more like the Solar or Abyssal ones where appropriate. Then I got tired of all the anima effects being boring and just started adding whatever I felt like. Some of them are clearly broken. They exist in their current state mostly to indicate direction. I need to sit down and do proper play simulations. I'll probably read others' campaign logs since my group is not ready to go yet.

The charms doc is of course mostly a placeholder. Since I intend on having a lot of effects occur on a logistical scale, I have to really think about what that means. How will charms interact with Ventures and Battle Groups?

Also, I will continue to never capitalize "charms." Too many proper nouns makes a lot of passages hard to read in Exalted.
