Do you know why Time is a wheel? Do you know why the mark of an Age is when a new holy tyrant rises? Do you know why those previous statements are held to be true? Even when the Anathema Deliberative overthrown by the Shogunate -- a military junta with no true unity? Even though the Shogunate's own rule was ended by disease?

The myth preys upon a belief held true by every faith and creed in Creation and beyond: the hero.

When the Makers of All arose from the formless chaos, they were each co-equal until the coming of the Primordial King. With him came notions of order and hierarchy, but the Makers themselves were not lessened. Each had their role; their works were merely centralized and directed now. Together, they made many wonders until at last came the world you know. It was in this time that Gaia, Mother of the Elemental Dragons beloved by all, taught her most beneficent children the ways of harmony.

Then, my father whispered into the King's ear: make one like yourself, to rule over all the lesser things within. The King, stoked to his greatest vanity, made the Sun Himself. The Sun, in the beginning, was perfect and brilliant and would burn all the world to ash. He was too great. This was the glory of the King of the Gods -- divinity without equal -- the first true hero. This is my father's venom.

The Makers were co-equal, though they had a King. The gods, you know, hold many forms and powers. The mighty trample upon the weak and scheme to best their would-be equals. They abuse each other and their faithful if the Immaculate monks do not hold them to task. Who holds the King to task? Who has the right? Who has the strength?

Most importantly, who has the will?

Our world, it is believed, is ruled by a succession of hero-kings. They do so through divine right and unparalleled strength. Who should doubt the Scarlet Empress? Did she not appear in Creation's midnight to sweep away the fae hordes? Did she not keep us safe for eight centuries? Would she not be rejected by the Ruby Throne and literally unseated by the Dragons if she faltered on the righteous path?

Heaven has given us heroes because we asked for them. Is that truly the path to enlightenment? Perhaps we are coddled. Who is to say the Mandate of Heaven was not given to the Shogunate in the hopes that we might be more, that many might share the burden? When the Shogunate failed to save us, when humanity faltered, to a hero again we were given.

Duty and power are a pair. Yet few have the will to fully accept their given duty. Many times, we would prefer to give duty and power to another and instead pursue our leisure. There was a time when Creation gave all to the Scarlet Empress. In her absence, we find ourselves faced with new duties, and power is grasped by the corrupt.

For fear or for indolence, we may give power to a hero, but this is not the true way of the world. Did Mother Gaia not give her all to the Elemental Dragons and then depart? If the Dragons gave the Scarlet Empress to be our own mother, have we not clung to her side late into adulthood? Now we callously seek to find another hero, another parent to carry our burdens for us and shelter us from the dark.

Many times, we speak of humanity but mean only the heroes or those who would be heroes. Yet, there are myriad who would selflessly accept duty if they were only given the power to complete it. Should we not seek enlightenment together? Should we not seize power from the corrupt and give to the willing? Instead of searching so desperately for those who would lead us, let humankind finally leave the nest as siblings all.

This is the nature of my father's venom. The gods look to the Sun and do not question. Heaven gave unto us the Exalted, and we do not question. Who holds the Exalted to task? Who has the right? Who has the strength?

The righteousness of the Exalted may be challenged by another of their kind. This is how the fractured nature of human justice resolves itself. The strength of the Exalted, likewise, could be challenged only by another, for how could a mortal compare in magics or wisdom cultivated over many lifetimes?

Though we might burn with the will to leave our parents' home, to do so has never been justifiable or possible.

From my father's mouth, there is only venom. Today, I speak to you the cure.

The Makers placed into my heart and guardianship, souls in torment. These, I have made beautiful again and let fly to make new heroes -- new Exalted. These ones are not glorious parents to stand before you, to labor alone in the fields of darkness while you wait in safety. These are your elder siblings, to grasp the hands of those who wish to leave and guide you in the tasks which must be done.

These cannot protect you on their own. Just the same, they are not distant and strange, who speak in riddles and say "when you are older, you will understand". They will guide you on the righteous path, and in turn, you will one day join them.

This is more than metaphor -- I send unto you Exalted whose power depends on those they uplift. I send unto you Exalted who are at the mercy of "the common man", who are noble in their humility, who will join you in the fields and workshops instead of demanding your labor serve them. Why should you feed and arm a distant army of "heroes" when there is one who lives among you and makes preparations to defend your land because it is their land too?

The all-enlightened Elemental Dragons are co-equal, but their eldest brother, Lord Pasiap, is preeminent, for his centering guides them. So too were the Makers of All co-equal beneath their King. This is the true and highest state of affairs. I ask you now, children of man, to rise to the occasion and be co-equal with the Exalted.

I do not ask you to refute the Noble Insights as the Anathema did. To take the hands of your older siblings is to accept the call of deeper enlightenment without again entering the well of reincarnation. When I speak of distant and uncaring heroes among the older Exalted, I speak of those who have fallen from the righteous path and embody the Antitheses of the Immaculate Dragons. We live in dark times, and many reject their duty. I ask you to bear a greater burden in their place.

Your humble godmother,
Lillun
